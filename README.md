# faster_rcnn-opencv_-visualization
  A little change is made to the visual parts of the faster_rcnn (pytorch) version of demo.py. The original code is to use Matplotlib to frame every object in one picture in one picture. After the improvement of the opencv, all the direct frames are presented in a picture.
